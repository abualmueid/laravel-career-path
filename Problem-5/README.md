# Problem-5: Given an integer n, find the sum of the digits of the integer.

Sample input 1: <br>
62343 <br>
Sample output 1: <br> 
18 <br>

Sample input 2: <br>
1000 <br>
Sample output 2: <br> 
1 <br>

## How to solve: 

1. Take input from user and ensure it that it's an integer number.
2. Make a function to calculate the sum of the digits, which will finally return the sum.
3. Use a while loop. Keep adding the remainder of the integer number and updating the number each time. Do this until the number becomes 0.
4. Finally return the sum and print it.
